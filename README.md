# Backend Server
I have created the backend using node js, and express js.

## How to start Server on localhost : Once you clone this repo, go to backend folder and open terminal.

Run `npm install` to install the dependencies specified in my package.json file. It ensures that all the required packages are downloaded and ready to use.
I have used express, cors, body-parser and mongoose.

Run `node index.js` on terminal, you will see `Server is running on port 3000` `Db Connected Successfully` on terminal. Navigate to `http://localhost:3000/`. If you do any changes then restart the server using same command.
### you will see this response on localhost:3000 port.
